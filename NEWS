v1.1.2:
* fix memory UB in libsais
* restructure src/cm.c
* block size check in src/libbz3.c
* fix shift UB in lzp
* -h/-v CLI switches
* change maximum block size to ~512M

v1.1.3:
* fix a serious stdin/stdout CRLF bug on Windows that corrupted the data.
* imply `-c` when a stream isn't opened thus preventing potential UB.
* bzip3 file format documentation.
* increase the maximum amount of parallel workers to 24.
* prevent accidentally overwriting output; add the `-f` command-line flag.

v1.1.4:
* increase the maximum allowed amount of parallel workers to 64.
* clean up the cm code
* set up pkg-config support
* CLI robustness improvements

v1.1.5:
* rework the argument parsing schema to resemble UNIX utilities more.
* make compression the default action
* replace -v with -V for version information
* manual pages
* bz3cat, bz3more, bz3less, bz3grep, unbzip3 utilities
* disable architecture-specific optimisations in github release builds

v1.1.6:
* fixed tickets: #53, #50, #45, #46 (portability issues & a verbatim block
  decompression diagnostic issue)
* package unbzip3 manpage
* flockfile/funlockfile calls for WIN32

v1.1.7:
* rename unbzip3 as bunzip3 for bzip2/gzip/lzip/... compatibility.
* high level api for libbzip3: `bz3_bound`, `bz3_compress` and `bz3_decompress`.
* more robust decompression; safety checks for the RLE and LZP steps.
* documentation for the frame format.
* examples of bzip3 API usage, AFL fuzzing instructions.
* `bz3_version` API function
* more robust I/O handling and fsync (linux only) calls to ensure a correct I/O transaction.

v1.1.8:
* add the Apache-2.0 license of `libsais`.

v1.2.0:
* alias `-z` to `-e` (compatibility with bzip2).
* version bzip3 library.
* dynamically link library to the tool (eliminating the libbz3.c duplication in tool and library).
* add verbose output (via `-v`).
* add version information to the manual pages.
* set `rpath` in the Makefile to solve an issue with /usr/local/lib not being present in the dynamic linker search path.

v1.2.1:
* fix a LZP decompression bug when a match occurred before block boundary.
* don't set rpath in the Makefile
* fix build warnings from -v
* add `most` support
* windows binary mode fix

v1.2.2:
* safety fixes for the LZP pass.
* add the `-k` compatibility flag.
* use `env` to detect the shell in bzip3 utility scripts
* update libtool to v2.4.7

v1.2.3:
* fix an important regression introduced in pull request #55 regarding I/O in main.c
* slightly enlargen the SAIS buffer beyond the documented recommended size to avoid some memory errors in libsais
* properly handle a scenario where the individual block original size is larger than the block size declared in the file header
* further security fixes: strict check for size_src overflow of badly bounded b1, store mode: checking for truncation
  mRLE: decoding bounds, bz3_bound in bz3_decompress
