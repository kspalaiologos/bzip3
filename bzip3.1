.TH bzip3 1
.SH NAME
bzip3 \- an efficient statistical file compressor and spiritual successor to bzip2

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bzip3
.RB [ " \-bcdehftv " ]
[
.I "filenames \&..."
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Compress or decompress a file using run length encoding and Lempel Ziv
prediction, followed by the Burrows-Wheeler transform and arithmetic coding.
.BR bzip3 ,
like its ancestor
.BR bzip2 ,
excels at compressing text or source code.

The command-line options are deliberately very similar to
those of
.BR bzip2,
but they are not identical.
.PP
.BR bzip3
expects at most two filenames intertwined with flags.
.BR bzip3
will by default not overwrite existing files.
If this behaviour is intended, use the \-f flag.

If no file names are specified,
.BR bzip3
will compress from standard input to standard output, refusing
to output binary data to a terminal. The \-e flag (encode) is implied.

.BR bzip3
\-d decompresses data from standard input to the standard output,
refusing to read from a terminal.

If two files are specified, the first one is used in place of
standard input, and the second one is used in place of standard
output.

If the \-c flag is present, bzip3 will read from the specified
file and output data to standard output instead. Otherwise, if decoding,
.BR bzip3
will try to guess the decompressed filename by removing the
.I .bz3
extension. If not present, an error will be reported. If encoding,
the output filename will be generated by appending the
.I .bz3
extension to the input filename.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-b --block N
Set the block size to N mebibytes. The minimum is 1MiB, the maximum is 511MiB.
.TP
.B \-c --stdout
Force writing output data to the standard output if one file is specified.
.TP
.B \-d --decode
Force decompression.
.TP
.B \-e --encode
Force compression (default behaviour).
.TP
.B \-f --force
Overwrite existing files.
.TP
.B \-h --help
Display a help message and exit.
.TP
.B \-V --version
Display version information and exit.
.TP
.B \-j --jobs N
Set the amount of parallel worker threads that process one block each.
.TP
.B \-t --test
Verify the validity of compressed blocks.
.TP
.B \--
Treat all subsequent arguments as file names, even if they start with a dash.
This is so you can handle files with names beginning with a dash.
.SH FILE FORMAT

Compression is performed as long as the input block is longer than 64 bytes.
Otherwise, it's coded as a literal block. In all other cases, the compressed data
is written to the file. The file format has constant overhead of 9 bytes per
file and from 9 to 17 bytes per block. Random data is coded so that expansion
is generally under 0.8%.

.BR bzip3
uses 32-bit CRC to ensure that the decompressed version of a file is
identical to the original. This guards against corruption of the
compressed data. 

.SH MEMORY MANAGEMENT

The \-b flag sets the block size in mebibytes (MiB). The default is 16 MiB.
Compression and decompression memory usage can be esimated as:

       6 x block size

Larger block sizes usually give rapidly diminishing returns.
It is also important to appreciate that the decompression memory
requirement is set at compression time by the choice of block size.
In general, try and use the largest block size memory constraints allow,
since that maximises the compression achieved.  Compression and
decompression speed are virtually unaffected by block size.
